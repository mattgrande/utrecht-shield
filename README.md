# Welcome to the Utrecht Shield

## What is it?

A Challenge Trophy to be put up by the current holder, or defender, in every match it plays home or away (in the same manner as a world boxing title). The winner would either remain or become the holder. Essentially, it's the [Raeburn Shield](http://www.raeburnshield.com/), but for women's rugby.
