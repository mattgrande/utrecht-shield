        <p>The Utrecht Shield is a challenge trophy to be put up by the current holder, or defender, in every match it plays home or away (in the same manner as a world boxing title). The winner would either remain or become the holder. Essentially, it’s the Raeburn Shield, but for women’s rugby.</p>

                <p>It is not currently recognised by any governing body however, much like the Raeburn Shield, we hope it someday will be.</p>
